# Plotly Overview

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each of her volunteers. She has asked to build a page so tha her volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The purpose of this data is to identify if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
